<strong>
This a mock technical documentation page, and not very technical at that; it <br>
is not meant to go into details on the topic discussed. <br>
This page is meant to pass all tests on a FCC project and may be used as a quick revision or guide <br>
Lastly, this project does not focus on responsiveness
